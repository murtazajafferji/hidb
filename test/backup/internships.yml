  review: "My time at Tribune can be characterized by one word: variety. I have been assigned such diverse tasks at Tribune and it has allowed me to explore and learn a wide range of computer science concepts and programming techniques. The three major projects that have worked on have really made me a much more well--rounded programmer.  Fixing bugs for P2P has given me valuable experience with working on an agile team, heading the migration of Triblink from LDAP to Active Directory servers has increased my problem--solving capabilities and scripting skills, and working on Focal Point has developed my knowledge of databases and my level of comfort with being responsible for large scale operations."
