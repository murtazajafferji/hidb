			My name is Murtaza Jafferji and I am a student at Brandeis University. I created Amal Tracker to learn, experiment, and improve my programming skills.
			</p>
			<p>
			Amal Tracker is designed to help you to keep track and learn about deeni amal.
			</p>
			<p>
			On Amal Tracker, you track namazes, duas, tasbihs, events, Quran tilawat, rozas, that you have missed, prayed, performed, attended, or completed.Â
